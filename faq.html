                    Yes, our cans are infinitely recyclable. In fact, of all the aluminum produced since 1888, 75% of it is still currently in use. Compare that to plastic which basically isn't recycled anymore because it's simply not profitable. #DeathToPlastic

                    First, congrats. We can't wait to meet the little demon. Second, we definitely recommend drinking Liquid Death Mountain Water while pregnant because water is even more important when you're hydrating for two. (Only our Iced Teas contain a microdose of 30mg of caffeine. Check with your doc if you have questions about caffeine.)

                    Most bottled water on the market comes in 20 oz servings. To deliver more Liquid Death to you and thus more efficiently chainsaw your thirst to bits, we've introduced new King Size cans. You may continue to see some of the original size tallboys around for a while though.

                    Tracking on water and tea orders is provided by the retailer you ordered through. Check with them for updates.

                    In most instances, your order should not arrive with plastic packaging. Unfortunately, there may be some times when it does. For example, if you order a single case of Liquid Death along with other items they may pack the box using some plastic. The upside is that consolidating shipping with a single carrier reduces our carbon footprint significantly. This change will be an overall benefit to the environment so we thought it was worth making.
